### Difficulty
Within this two weeks, I learned html, css and js and I had a hard time on how to apply the knowledge on this project. At the beginning, I draw many sketches and figured out how the html structures are. I use the header as an example, I need to know how display:flex, flex-basis are use, how many div it needs for the logo, navigation bar and cart separately. After that, I had a clear picture in mind of the site structure and helped me to add classes and organize elements more efficient. For the responsive design, I listed out all the difference between mobile, tablet and desktop view. As well as how it changes between various views.
